    "motivations": "My engagement in Cardano governance is initially driven by two key factors. First, the aim to contribute to a long-term governance vision that also incorporates voting rights for individuals without large ADA reserves, utilizing Decentralized Identifiers. Second, I seek to provide stability in the early governance phase by building upon existing achievements and implementing measured changes to mitigate risks of early failure.",
    "objectives": "I support the integration of identity solutions based on open standards such as the W3C DID specification, Verifiable Credentials, and Verifiable Presentations. I further would prioritize governance actions that promote real-world use cases over self-referencing crypto narratives. Additionally, I advocate for implementing a restrained budgeting process that maintains fiscal responsibility and long term planning while incentivizing new ecosystem participants.",

    "qualifications": "My qualifications for contributing to Cardano governance stem from long-time participation in the Cardano and Hyperledger Identus (Atala PRISM) communities. I have a proven track record of developing and delivering identity-focused software through Catalyst and beyond. As an experienced .NET developer, I have a history of collaboration with both startups and enterprises. Furthermore, I am a successful entrepreneur managing real-world businesses with employees.",
